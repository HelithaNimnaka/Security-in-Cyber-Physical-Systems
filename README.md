### Milestone 1 Securing a Smart Building System 🏢🔐
- Analyzed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Honeywell smart building systems.  
- Identified threats:
  - Weak encryption & poor key management 🔓
  - Weak password policies & improper access controls 🚫

- Mitigation strategies & best practices:
  - Enhanced encryption (AES-256, TLS 1.3) 🔐
  - Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) and strong passwords 🛡️
  - Regular updates & Network Segmentation 🌐
  - Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) 🔍
  - Real-time Intrusion Detection & Security audits 🔒

### Milestone 2: Cryptographic API Implementation 🔑💻
Developed a secure Cryptographic API for encryption, decryption, and hashing.  
Implemented features:
- RSA and AES key generation 🔑
- RSA encryption/decryption (with OAEP padding) 🔒
- Hashing (SHA-256, SHA-512) for integrity checks ✅

- Security enhancements:
  - Secure key management and storage 💼
  - Access control and authentication mechanisms 🔑
  - Robust error handling ⚙️
